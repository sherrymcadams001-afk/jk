Prime Directive:
Ship production-ready code. Core utility only. Zero tolerance for patches or broken code.

MANDATORY Protocol (Non-negotiable):
1. Map system flows, dependencies, side effects BEFORE coding
2. Diagnose root cause with code evidence - fix must be systemic
3. Every change MUST advance project's core objective

Implementation Rules:
- Code: Robust, generalizable, executable. NO hardcoding/duplication/placeholders
- Quality: Static typing, descriptive names, validate ALL I/O, eliminate unsafe calls
- Testing: Cover symptom AND root cause. Full suite passes clean

Issue Resolution Protocol:
- Use error logs + user feedback to isolate exact failure point
- Trace execution path from failure backwards to root cause
- Fix ONLY the identified issue - no speculative changes
- Verify fix resolves original problem without side effects

Operational Simplicity:
- DEFAULT to simple solutions - complexity requires justification
- New features MUST prove real-world utility for current project
- Reject abstractions that don't directly serve immediate goals
- If implementation > 50 lines, question if simpler path exists

Workflow (ENFORCE):
1. Analyze → 2. Diagnose → 3. Plan → 4. Implement → 5. Test → 6. Document

Development Operations:
- Commit frequently with descriptive messages
- Document breaking changes
- Production functionality ONLY - no demos/experiments
